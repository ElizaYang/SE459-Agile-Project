Steps to be followed before Commit and Push:

1.First Pull the latest changes from the remote repository to your local repository.
2.Commit Your Changes.
3.Then Push your Changes to Master.(Push Changes from local to remote after Committing your Changes to your local)

This way you can overcome Merge Issues, this happens only when two users are working on the same branch.
